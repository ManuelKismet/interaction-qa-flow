# IntQAFlow hosted development checkpoint

Updated 2026-10-02. Founder authorized a real hosted development backend,
Google Cloud/Firebase access, and a GBP 25 monthly backend spending allowance.
Knowledge and Interact remain one platform. Production comes later.

## Verified cloud foundation

- Dedicated project: intqaflow-dev (398672910103).
- Firebase project ACTIVE; addFirebase operation completed successfully.
- Billing linked to the existing open GBP account.
- Project-only monthly budget: GBP 25, excluding credits; actual alerts at
  50%, 80%, 100%, plus a forecasted 100% alert. Budget alerts are not a hard cap.
- Budget ID: 996a1e77-086f-482a-a71a-0f1fe4fe8fb4.
- Cloud SQL creation submitted: intqaflow-dev-pg, PostgreSQL 16, Enterprise,
  db-f1-micro, europe-west2 (London), zonal, 10 GB SSD, no automatic disk growth.
- Seven daily backups configured, starting at 02:00 UTC; PITR disabled for this
  small development instance. Connector enforcement REQUIRED, encrypted
  connections only, IAM database authentication enabled. No IP allowlist added.
- The devcontainer no longer creates a PostgreSQL sidecar. Its database URL is
  a deliberately unusable cloud-connection placeholder until a scoped
  authenticated proxy/connector is configured. Loopback proxying would connect
  to the managed cloud database; it does not host a local database.
- Existing sidecar volume was not deleted. Rebuild the Codespace only after
  recording required state and verifying the cloud connection.

## Application gates and ownership

The platform is NOT running. The clean source import still fails in
backend/app/services/team.py:157: TypeError: function object is not subscriptable.
No workaround or application remediation was applied. Existing audit IQ-01
remains open. Codex owns this infrastructure/configuration setup; Copilot owns
application fixes and relevant tests; founder + Codex review together.

Prepared Copilot scope (not yet assigned):
1. Fix IQ-01 with the smallest supported-Python source change; run clean import
   and the existing backend suite, without changing unrelated audit findings.
2. Implement Firebase Auth in Flutter and validate Firebase ID tokens on the
   backend. Derive user/organisation/role from server-controlled membership;
   reject forged development identity headers and cross-tenant requests.
3. Add repeatable synthetic tenant/user seeding and verify Knowledge, Interact,
   Review and recursive participant branches against managed PostgreSQL.

Pending infrastructure acceptance: database RUNNABLE status, database creation,
pgvector installation, scoped database roles/credentials, Cloud Run container
build and private service deployment, Firebase web app/provider setup, browser
access rejection outside the permitted boundary, migrations and live checks.
Do not publish the unauthenticated development-identity API to solve access.
No production environment, application deployment or release was performed.

## Resume

Use Codespace bookish-happiness-w974vpwgq7j3g95v and draft PR #2 on
chore/intqaflow-private-dev-isolation. Google Cloud SDK is installed at
$HOME/.local/share/intqaflow/gcloud/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud.
Use explicit --project=intqaflow-dev and --billing-project=intqaflow-dev
where required; do not change other applications' resources or defaults.
Do not print tokens, passwords or credential files. User login remains in
the private Codespace for the authorized task; no credentials are committed.
